# Flashcard-Generator

Hello

this is my first attemp using the read me file so please be kind.

i was attempting to comlete the assigngment and wasnt able to figure out how to do a proper call back so that i could cycle through my cloze cards correctly.  i have a for loop going currently and what that does is go through each question all at once which isnt really what i want...

i think i need to use a callback function by wrapping the inquirer in a function somehow and then having it call for each iteration but i am not sure how to have the cards be assigned any type of iteration scheme with out being in a loop.. and the loop prints all the qs at once which is not what i want..

thanks for taking thwe time to read this and i hope you have a good time learning little factoids about the history of the USA.

Sincerely,

Paul Choza
